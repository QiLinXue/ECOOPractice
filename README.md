# ECOOPractice

As practice for the upcoming competetition, I'm solving past problems for the computing contest held by the Educational Computing Organization of Ontario. All the solutions are posted here, written in java. 

Feel free to use my code but keep in mind that it can be very inefficient. Any fixes or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
